I'm currently a technical analyst at Goldman Sachs, Bangalore working on very interesting projects. I completed my BE Degree in Information Science and Engineering from [PES Institute of Technology](https://www.pes.edu/), Bangalore ( Batch of 2014-2018 ). 
I'm most interested in tackling problems in the **Machine Learning**, **Natural Language Processing** and **Computer Vision** domains.
